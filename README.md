# AI Hair Recommendation System (School Project)

This is an AI-powered tool that gives personalized hair care recommendations (shampoo, conditioner, treatments, weekly routine) based on your hair type, scalp condition, damage level, goals, and concerns.

Built with:
- Streamlit (web interface)
- OpenAI API (GPT for smart recommendations)

## How to Run Locally (for classmates / professor)

1. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/qacollin/HairRecommendationSystem.git

2. Go into the folder:

cd HairRecommendationSystem

3. Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a file called `.env` in the same folder and add your own OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here

(Sign up free at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys if you don't have one — free tier works for testing.)
5. Run the app: 
Your browser will open http://localhost:8501 — fill in the form and get recommendations!
